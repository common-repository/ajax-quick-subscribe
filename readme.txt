Allows visitors to quickly subscribe to your blog using only an email address
without linking to a new page, or reloading the current page.

== Description ==

Allows visitors to quickly subscribe to your blog using only an email address
without needing to load a new page. Custom feedback is provided instantly in
line.

This is an extrapolation of Quick Subscribe plugin by Leo Germani, adding AJAX
functionality for smoother operation.

The widget will present a text field where the visitor will enter an email address. No email confirmation is sent to the visitor, a user name based on the email address (the email without the @) is created and the password is randomly generated.

Before the user's input is registered, the email address is checked for
validity, and to ensure that they are not already subscribed. If either is
true, then the input form is re-displayed with a user-defined error message...
All without re-loading the page.

This is perfect if you want your readers to easily subscribe to your blog without the need of having an username and password. The ideia is to use the list of subscribers as a mailing to send news, updates or whatever you want to send to your readers.

You can use it together with plugins such as Subcscribe2 and WPMailing

== Installation ==

. Download the package
. Extract it to the "plugins" folder of your wordpress
. In the Admin Panes go to "Plugins" and activate it
. Go to Appearance > Widgets and/or Setting->AJAX Quick Subscribe to set it
up (See below)

== Usage ==

There are three ways to insert the quick subscribe form:
